### Enzyme

With enzyme 3 we need an adapter. Adapter allows us to specify exactly which version of react we are gonna test against. This allows core enzyme library to be smaller. It does not need to have all of the code for all of the various versions of react that supported. Instead we just specify which one we need by installing the adapter that keeps the core library light and keeps your entire code base more manageable.
